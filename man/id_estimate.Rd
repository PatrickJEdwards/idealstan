\item{model_type}{An integer reflecting the kind of model to be estimated. See below.}

\item{vary_ideal_pts}{Default \code{'none'}. If \code{'random_walk'} or \code{'AR1'}, a 
time-varying ideal point model will be fit with either a random-walk process or an 
AR1 process. See documentation for more info.}

\item{sample_it}{Whether or not to use a random subsample of the response matrix. Useful for testing.}

\item{subset_group}{If person/legislative data was included in the \code{\link{id_make}} function, then you can subset by
any value in the \code{$group} column of that data if \code{use_subset} is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{subset_person}{A list of character values of names of persons/legislators to use to subset if \code{use_subset} is 
\code{TRUE} and person/legislative data was included in the \code{\link{id_make}} function with the required \code{$person.names}
column}

\item{sample_size}{If \code{sample_it} is \code{TRUE}, this value reflects how many legislators/persons will be sampled from
the response matrix}

\item{nchains}{The number of chains to use in Stan's sampler. Minimum is one. See \code{\link[rstan]{stan}} for more info.}

\item{niters}{The number of iterations to run Stan's sampler. Shouldn't be set much lower than 500. See \code{\link[rstan]{stan}} for more info.}

\item{use_vb}{Whether or not to use Stan's variational Bayesian inference engine instead of full Bayesian inference. Pros: it's much faster.
Cons: it's not quite as accurate. See \code{\link[rstan]{vb}} for more info.}

\item{restrict_ind_high}{If \code{fixtype} is not "vb", the particular indices of legislators/persons or bills/items to constrain high}

\item{id_diff}{The fixed difference between the high/low person/legislator ideal points used to identify the model. 
Set at 4 as a standard value but can be changed to any arbitrary number without affecting model results besides re-scaling.}

\item{id_diff_high}{The fixed intercept of the high ideal point used to constrain the model.}

\item{restrict_ind_low}{If \code{fixtype} is not "vb", the particular indices of legislators/persons or bills/items to constrain low. 
(Note: not used if values are pinned).}

\item{fixtype}{Sets the particular kind of identification used on the model, could be one of 'vb_full' 
(identification provided exclusively by running a variational identification model with no prior info), 
'vb_partial' (two indices of ideal points to fix are provided but the values to fix are determined by the
identification model), 
'constrain' (two indices of ideal points to fix are provided--only sufficient for model if \code{restrict_var} is 
\code{FALSE}, 
and 'prior_fit' (a previous identified \code{idealstan} fit is passed to the \code{prior_fit} option and used
as the basis for identification).
 See details for more information.}

\item{prior_fit}{If a previous \code{idealstan} model was fit \emph{with the same} data, then the same
identification constraints can be recycled from the prior fit if the \code{idealstan} object is passed 
to this option. Note that means that all identification options, like \code{restrict_var}, will also 
be the same}

\item{warmup}{The number of iterations to use to calibrate Stan's sampler on a given model. Shouldn't be less than 100. 
See \code{\link[rstan]{stan}} for more info.}

\item{ncores}{The number of cores in your computer to use for parallel processing in the Stan engine. 
See \code{\link[rstan]{stan}} for more info.}

\item{use_groups}{If \code{TRUE}, group parameters from the person/legis data given in \code{\link{id_make}} will be 
estimated instead of individual parameters.}

\item{discrim_reg_sd}{Set the prior standard deviation of the bimodal prior for the discrimination parameters for the non-inflated model.}

\item{discrim_miss_sd}{Set the prior standard deviation of the bimodal prior for the discrimination parameters for the inflated model.}

\item{person_sd}{Set the prior standard deviation for the legislators (persons) parameters}

\item{time_sd}{The precision (inverse variance) of the over-time component of the person/legislator
parameters. A higher value will allow for less over-time variation (useful if estimates bounce too much). 
Default is 4.}

\item{sample_stationary}{If \code{TRUE}, the AR(1) coefficients in a time-varying model will be 
sampled from an unconstrained space and then mapped back to a stationary space. Leaving this \code{TRUE} is 
slower but will work better when there is limited information to identify a model. If used, the
\code{ar_sd} parameter should be increased to 5 to allow for wider sampling in the unconstrained space.}

\item{ar_sd}{If an AR(1) model is used, this defines the prior scale of the Normal distribution. A lower number 
can help 
identify the model when there are few time points.}

\item{diff_reg_sd}{Set the prior standard deviation for the bill (item) intercepts for the non-inflated model.}

\item{diff_miss_sd}{Set the prior standard deviation for the bill (item) intercepts for the inflated model.}

\item{restrict_sd}{Set the prior standard deviation for constrained parameters}

\item{restrict_mean}{Whether or not to restrict the over-time mean of an ideal point 
(additional identification measure when standard fixes don't work). \code{TRUE} by 
default for random-walk models.}

\item{restrict_var}{Whether to limit variance to no higher than 0.5 for random-walk time series models.
If left blank (the default), will be set to \code{TRUE} for random-walk models and \code{FALSE} for 
AR(1) models if identification is still a challenge (note: using this for AR(1) models is 
probably overkill).}

\item{restrict_mean_val}{For random-walk models, the mean of a time-series ideal point to constrain.
Should not be set a priori (leave blank) unless you are absolutely sure. Otherwise it is set by 
the identification model.}

\item{restrict_mean_ind}{For random-walk models, the ID of the person/group whose over-time
mean to constrain. Should be left blank (will be set by identification model) unless you are 
really sure.}

\item{restrict_var_high}{The upper limit for the variance parameter (if \code{restrict_var=TRUE} & 
model is a random-walk time-series). If left blank, either defaults to 0.1 or is set by 
identification model.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed on to Stan's sampling engine. See \code{\link[rstan]{stan}} for more information.}
}
\value{
A fitted \code{\link{idealstan}} object that contains posterior samples of all parameters either via full Bayesian inference
or a variational approximation if \code{use_vb} is set to \code{TRUE}. This object can then be passed to the plotting functions for further analysis.
}
\description{
This function will take a pre-processed \code{idealdata} vote/score dataframe and 
run one of the available IRT/latent space ideal point models on the data using
Stan's MCMC engine.
}
\details{
To run an IRT ideal point model, you must first pre-process your data using the \code{\link{id_make}} function. Be sure to specify the correct options for the
kind of model you are going to run: if you want to run an unbounded outcome (i.e. Poisson or continuous),
the data needs to be processed differently. Also any hierarchical covariates at the person or item level
need to be specified in \code{\link{id_make}}. If they are specified in \code{\link{id_make}}, than all 
subsequent models fit by this function will have these covariates.

\strong{Note that for static ideal point models, the covariates are only defined for those 
persons who are not being used as constraints.}

As of this version of \code{idealstan}, the following model types are available:
\enumerate{
  \item IRT 2-PL (binary response) ideal point model, no missing-data inflation
  \item IRT 2-PL ideal point model (binary response) with missing- inflation
  \item Ordinal IRT (rating scale) ideal point model no missing-data inflation
  \item Ordinal IRT (rating scale) ideal point model with missing-data inflation
  \item Ordinal IRT (graded response) ideal point model no missing-data inflation
  \item Ordinal IRT (graded response) ideal point model with missing-data inflation
  \item Poisson IRT (Wordfish) ideal point model with no missing data inflation
  \item Poisson IRT (Wordfish) ideal point model with missing-data inflation
  \item unbounded (Gaussian) IRT ideal point model with no missing data
  \item unbounded (Gaussian) IRT ideal point model with missing-data inflation
  \item Positive-unbounded (Log-normal) IRT ideal point model with no missing data
  \item Positive-unbounded (Log-normal) IRT ideal point model with missing-data inflation
  \item Latent Space (binary response) ideal point model with no missing data
  \item Latent Space (binary response) ideal point model with missing-data inflation
}

In addition, each of these models can have time-varying ideal point (person) parameters if
a column of dates is fed to the \code{\link{id_make}} function. If the option \code{vary_ideal_pts} is 
set to 'random_walk', \code{id_estimate} will estimate a random-walk ideal point model where ideal points 
move in a random direction. If \code{vary_ideal_pts} is set to \code{'AR1'}, a stationary ideal point model 
is estimated where ideal points fluctuate around long-term mean. In general, the stationary model
is preferred when the time series is of short absolute duration (such as days or hours) while 
the random-walk model is preferable when the time series is of very long duration and there are no
natural limits to the ideal points. Please see the package vignette and associated paper for more detail
about these time-varying models.
The inflation model used to account for missing data assumes that missingness is a 
function of the persons' (legislators')
ideal points. In other words,the model will take into account if people with high or low ideal points
tend to have more/less missing data on a specific item/bill. If there isn't any relationship
between missing data and ideal points, then the model assumes that the missingness is ignorable 
conditional on each
item, but it will still adjust the results to reflect these ignorable (random) missingness.

To leave missing data out of the model, simply choose a version of the model in the list above
that is non-inflated.

Models can be either fit on the person/legislator IDs or on group-level IDs (as specified to the 
\code{id_make} function). If group-level parameters should be fit, set \code{use_groups} to \code{TRUE}.
}
\section{Identification}{

Identifying IRT models is challenging, and ideal point models are still more challenging 
because the discrimination parameters are not constrained.
As a result, more care must be taken to obtain estimates that are the same regardless of starting values. 
The parameter \code{fixtype} enables you to change the type of identification used. The default, 'vb_full', 
does not require any further
information from you in order for the model to be fit. In this version of identification, an unidentified model is run using
variational Bayesian inference (see \code{\link[rstan]{vb}}). The function will then select two 
persons/legislators that end up on either end of the ideal point spectrum, and pin their ideal points
to those specific values. This is sufficient to identify all of the static models and also the AR(1) 
time-varying models. For random-walk time-varying models, identification is more difficult (see vignette).
Setting the option \code{restrict_mean} to \code{TRUE} will implement additional identification 
constraints on random-walk models.
A particularly convenient option for \code{fixtype} is \code{'vb_partial'}. In this case, the user
should pass the IDs (as a character vector) of the persons to constrain high (\code{restrict_ind_high}) and
low (\code{restrict_ind_low}). A model will then be fit to find the likely positions of these parameters,
which will then be used to fit an identified model. In this way, the user can achieve a certain
shape of the ideal point distribution without needing to choose specific values ahead of time to pin
parameters to.
If a prior model has been estimated with the same data, the user can re-use those identification 
settings by passing the fitted \code{idealstan} object to the \code{prior_fit} option.
